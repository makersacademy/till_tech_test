Good news: I have actually put together something that seems to be working (Version 1), and I have done it in a BDD way (I think).

Bad news: I was so carried way by the process tha commits are very few. The code could be DRYed out, particularly in the test suite, but it is late at night and I'd better stop now. 

I did very little upfront design but one thing that was constantly preent in my mind was SRP which is why I tried to break the app into small components. I know that printing and calculating can be separated further but the 'late at night' argument applies here as well.

I roughly understand how to deal with the JSON file provided but my priority was to submit something that can be code-reviewed by end of day Tuesday, so in this sorry hipster coffee shop there is only cappucino and cortado.
