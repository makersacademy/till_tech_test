We want to sell tills to local hipster coffee shop who are finally embracing the 21st century. We need a new till to replace their vintage machines - unfortunately, hipster staff are too cool to learn a new system, so we need you to build something that they will understand.

Specification
-------------

This is what a sample receipt looks like:

![a receipt](/images/receipt.jpg)

Version 1
---------

Implement a system that contains the business logic to produce receipts similar to this, based on a `json` price list and test orders. A sample `.json` file has been provided with the list of products sold at this particular coffee shop. 

Here are some sample orders you can try - whether you use this information is up to you:

> **Jane**  
> 2 x Cafe Latte  
> 1 x Blueberry Muffin  
> 1 x Choc Mudcake  
>
> **John**  
> 4 x Americano  
> 2 x Tiramisu  
> 5 x Blueberry Muffin  

Your receipt must calculate and show the correct amount of tax (in this shop's case, 8.64%), as well as correct line totals and total amount. Do not worry about calculating discounts or change yet. Consider what output formats may be suitable.

Version 2
---------

- Add functionality to take payment and calculate correct change.  
- Add functionality to handle discounts - in this example, a 5% discount on orders over $50, and a 10% muffin discount.
- Add functionality to print date and time on receipt

Version 3
---------

Implement an user interface that can actually be used as a till.

You may use whatever technologies you see fit.

Tech Used
---------
Written in Javascript and AngularJS, and tested in Jasmine and Protractor.

To Run
-------
Navigate to any folder and in the command line:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/ashleigh090990/till_tech_test

$ cd till_tech_test

$ npm install

$ bower install
```

You may have to install npm and bower before installing the dependencies.

To run the Jasmine tests from the command line, navigate to the folder that the SpecRunner.html is in and run the command "open SpecRunner.html" to run the Jasmine tests (they are all passing, but for some reason when running these same Jasmine tests throuh Karma, 6 fail as '.includes()' is not recognised as a method? Will be looking into that, as I want to get these tests running for Travis).

To run the Protractor tests, run "protractor spec/e2e/conf.js" from the command line. <<< NOT RUNNING SIMPLE TESTS... CHECK ON THIS

To run the application, in one terminal tab:

```
$ webdriver-manager start
```

And in another terminal tab:

```
$ http-server ./
```

Then in Google Chrome, navigate to "http://localhost:8080/" and the application should load!
